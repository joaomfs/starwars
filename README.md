# starwars-planets

Simple REST API designed to store Star Wars planets, written in Python using Flask and MongoDB database.

## Running the project

To run this project, first we need to prepare the environment:
```
* virtualenv flask
* cd flask
* pip3 install flask
* pip3 install markupsafe
* pip install flask-pymongo
* pip install requests

```

And create a MongoDB database called 'StarWars'

Then, run the starwars-planets.py
```
* python starwars-planets.py
```

## Using Postman

You can use an tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
The planets sent to API must follow the following JSON format:

```
{
    "name": "Cato Neimoidia",
    "climate": temperate, moist",
    "terrain": "mountains, fields, forests, rock arches"
}
```

To Update, you only need to send the fields you want to update.

The API will get the movies apparitions from the named planet, if exists, and will persist in the database.
